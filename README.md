# vdisk-tools

Command line tools to manage vhd/vhdx files. Can be used on Windows 10 in a [Busybox](https://frippery.org/busybox/) shell.
One can utilize my [multicall-sh-runner](https://github.com/mr-south-guo/multicall-sh-runner) to run these tools directly in a Windows 10 Command Prompt.

Note: Only tested on Windows 10 (1909). It relies on `diskpart.exe`, which may have different behaviour on other Windows versions.
